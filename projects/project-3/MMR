# Estimation of Maternal Mortality Rate Using Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of our coursework at FSU, done by a group of 2, this aims to estimate the **Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)** and analyze its key indicators using **regression techniques**. The objective is to build a robust predictive model that identifies significant factors influencing MMR and helps in understanding their impact.

## Research Motivation
**Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)** represents the number of maternal deaths per **100,000 live births**. Reliable data on maternal deaths is often limited, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Using **regression models**, we aim to fill this gap by estimating MMR based on available health and demographic surveys and identifying key predictors that influence maternal mortality.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of **248 observations** collected from various sources, including **Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)**. It includes **9 predictor variables** related to healthcare access, maternal health conditions, and socio-economic factors.

### Key Variables:
- **Response Variable:**
  - `MMRo`: Maternal Mortality Rate (deaths per 100,000 live births)
- **Predictor Variables:**
  - `CPR_modern`: Contraceptive Prevalence Rate
  - `ANC_4`: Antenatal Care Coverage
  - `HID`: Health Institution Delivery Rate
  - `CS`: Cesarean Section Rate
  - `PNC`: Postnatal Care Coverage
  - `Anemia_preg`: Prevalence of Maternal Anemia
  - `Thin`: Prevalence of Thinness (BMI < 18.5 kg/m²)
  - `HIV_final`: HIV Prevalence Among Women
  - `Ht_145`: Prevalence of Maternal Stunting

## Methodology
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using median imputation.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Assessed variable distributions and outliers.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Examined relationships between MMR and predictors.

### 2. **Regression Modeling**
- **Variable Selection Techniques:**
  - Forward Selection, Backward Selection, Stepwise Selection
  - Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression to identify key predictors.
- **Final Model:**
  - Selected the best-performing model based on **Adjusted R² and RMSE**.
  - Identified four key predictors: `CPR_modern`, `HID`, `log(CS)`, `HIV_final`.

### 3. **Model Diagnostics**
- **Collinearity Check:** Verified using **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** and correlation plots.
- **Assumption Testing:**
  - **Homoscedasticity:** Checked using the **Breusch-Pagan Test**.
  - **Normality of Errors:** Evaluated using **Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk test**.
  - **Influential Observations:** Identified and removed high-leverage points.

### 4. **Model Performance Evaluation**
- **Final Model Metrics:**
  - **Adjusted R²:** 76.2%
  - **RMSE:** 103.2
  - **P-values for all predictors < 0.05**, confirming statistical significance.
- **Validation Performance:**
  - Tested the model on unseen data, achieving **R² = 57.2%**, indicating potential overfitting.

## Results and Insights
- **Higher contraceptive prevalence (`CPR_modern`) reduces MMR**, supporting the hypothesis that birth control improves maternal health.
- **Health institution delivery (`HID`) lowers MMR**, highlighting the importance of professional medical care during childbirth.
- **Cesarean section rate (`log(CS)`) has a strong relationship with MMR**, indicating the impact of surgical deliveries on maternal health.
- **HIV prevalence (`HIV_final`) significantly influences MMR**, reinforcing the need for targeted maternal healthcare interventions.

## Limitations and Future Work
- **Limited dataset (248 observations):** Additional data from diverse regions could improve model robustness.
- **More predictive variables:** Exploring additional socio-economic and healthcare factors could enhance the model.
- **Validation on external datasets:** Testing on real-world maternal health records could further validate findings.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. **Load the dataset** (`mmr_data.csv`).
2. **Run the preprocessing script** to clean data and handle missing values.
3. **Execute regression models** using the provided scripts.
4. **Visualize results** using statistical plots and diagnostic tests.
5. **Evaluate the final model** based on Adjusted R² and RMSE.

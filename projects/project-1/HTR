In this project I am talking about Efficient Handwritten Text Recognition Using Gated-CNN-BGRU Architecture for Diverse Applications

1. Overview :        
This project focuses on developing an advanced offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using deep learning techniques. 
The system transcribes cursive handwritten text into digital formats like ASCII or Unicode, enabling applications such as digitizing historical documents, automating workflows, and improving accessibility. 
A novel architecture, GatedCNN-BGRU, is proposed to enhance recognition accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

2. Key Features
Model Architecture: Combines Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (Gated-CNNs) for feature extraction and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRUs) for sequence modeling.
Compact Design: Approximately 820,000 parameters, ensuring efficiency for mobile or embedded devices.
Effective Noise Handling: Robust preprocessing techniques like deslanting, illumination compensation, and data augmentation.
Evaluation Metrics: Character Error Rate (CER) of 9.66% and Word Error Rate (WER) of 33.68%, demonstrating promising performance.

3. Applications
Cultural Preservation: Digitizing manuscripts and historical records.
Postal Services: Automating address recognition.
Banking: Processing handwritten forms and cheques.
Education: Digitizing notes and academic records.
Healthcare: Interpreting handwritten prescriptions.

4. Dataset
The system was trained and tested on multiple datasets, including:

Washington Dataset: Historical English letters.
IAM Dataset: Diverse English handwriting samples.
RIMES Dataset: French handwritten text.
Saint Gall Dataset: 9th-century Latin manuscripts.

5. Preprocessing
Images were normalized, deslanted, resized (1024x128), and augmented with techniques like rotation, erosion, and noise injection. 
Data was stored efficiently using the HDF5 format.

6. Results
CER: 9.66%
WER: 33.68%
SER: 57.12%
Average processing time: 0.24 seconds per image.

7. Future Enhancements
Incorporate transformer-based language models for better contextual understanding.
Extend support to multilingual text recognition.
Explore paragraph-level recognition tasks.
